    Hello! I'm Ben, currently wrapping up my final semester in software
    engineering and gearing up to dive into the professional world. My education
    has been about more than just academics, it's been a journey filled with
    hands-on learning and personal exploration. While I've gained valuable
    experience through a co-op at Ross Video and working at Canadian Bank Note
    Company, my true passion lies in the diverse projects and hobbies I pursue.
    It's this combination of professional experiences and a deep-seated passion
    for diverse tech projects and hobbies that truly shapes my story.

      My fascination with technology extends beyond the classroom or office.
      I've nurtured a wide range of interests, from frontend web development to
      full-stack applications. But it's not just about the software for me. I
      have a self-hosted homelab, a personal sandbox where I tinker with Docker,
      explore redundant storage servers, and manage virtual machines. This
      playground of technology has also led me to delve into home automation and
      data logging, working with tools like MQTT, InfluxDB, and Grafana. When it
      comes to hands-on electronics, I find joy in experimenting with
      microcontrollers such as Arduino and ESP based devices, challenging myself
      to bring new ideas to life.

      One of my favorite projects is a Halloween show I orchestrated every year
      in high school. This wasnâ€™t just a display of lights and music, it was a
      complex choreography of synchronized lights, atmospheric effects, and
      sounds, all controlled through a network of ESP8266 microcontrollers and a
      Raspberry Pi. The true satisfaction came from seeing my neighborhood
      gather in excitement, drawn to the show I had created. This project, while
      not the most architecturally sophisticated, showcased my passion for
      technology and my ability to turn a vision into reality.

      Beyond my technical work, my approach to problem-solving reflects my
      strong appreciation for quality and well-thought-out work. This mentality,
      which has been a constant since my Halloween projects, translates into my
      everyday life. A practical example is the hut I built to shield our
      recycling bins from snow. This project came from my desire to improve
      everyday functionality, applying my skills in a way that makes a real
      difference in day-to-day living. It's this satisfaction in identifying and
      addressing areas of improvement, whether in code or in my environment,
      that drives me.

      When I'm not coding or building, you'll find me in the kitchen,
      experimenting with recipes or baking. There's something magical about
      creating a dish from basic ingredients, like the recent roasted tomato and
      red pepper soup I made from scratch. Baking, too, is a realm of endless
      possibilities, from donuts to cinnamon buns and various cookies. My love
      for creating extends to 3D printing as well, a hobby sparked in university
      that has seen me print everything from furniture feet to a wall mount for
      my Oculus VR headset.

    My journey with technology began with a simple bucket of old wires at age
    four, igniting a curiosity that has defined my path. This early exploration
    of the practical aspects of technology laid the foundation for my ongoing
    search for knowledge and innovation. Starting with HTML experiments on my
    dad's old computer in elementary school, I've grown alongside the evolving
    world of technology. This progression led me to stay on the cutting edge,
    actively following tech-focused content creators like
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/fireship" target="_blank">Fireship</a>
    and following platforms like
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>. My
    passion for technology has been a constant in my life. It's this mix of
    childhood curiosity and professional focus that fuels my journey in the tech
    world.
